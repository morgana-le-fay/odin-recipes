    <h2>How To Make Lefsa</h2>
    <p>Lefse is an iconic holiday food served on the tables of Norweigian Americans on Thanksgiving and worldwide on Christmas. This delicious potato bread is akin to a tortilla, but Scandinavian style. It is often served with toppings, such as butter, sugar, cinnamon, jellies, and even savory ingredients.
